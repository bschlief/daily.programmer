#Write a program that reads text from a file, and then outputs the text to 
#another file but with all the lines reversed and all the words in each line 
#reversed.
#So, for instance, if you had one file called the "thetyger.txt" which 
#contained the two first verses of William Blake's The Tyger:
#Tyger! Tyger! burning bright 
#In the forests of the night, 
#What immortal hand or eye 
#Could frame thy fearful symmetry? 

#In what distant deeps or skies 
#Burnt the fire of thine eyes? 
#On what wings dare he aspire? 
#What the hand dare sieze the fire? 

#Your program would output this to "thetyger2.txt" (or whatever you want to 
#call the file):
#fire? the sieze dare hand the What
#aspire? he dare wings what On
#eyes? thine of fire the Burnt
#skies or deeps distant what In

#symmetry? fearful thy frame Could
#eye or hand immortal What
#night, the of forests the In
#bright burning Tyger! Tyger!
